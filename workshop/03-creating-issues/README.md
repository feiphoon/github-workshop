# Creating issues (everyone)

6. Create an issue based on a question (from a provided list, see below).
* Write a relevant title (e.g. "Favourite colours list needed")
* Add a description (What the problem is and how to solve it)
* No information is useless when creating an issue. Add as much as possible.


### Examples 

* What is your favourite colour?
* What is your favourite animal?
* What is your favourite food? 
* What is your professional/education background?
* Why did you join this workshop?
* What is your favourite programming language?
